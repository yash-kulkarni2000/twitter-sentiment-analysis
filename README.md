Sentiment Analysis is the automated process of analyzing text data and sorting it into sentiments positive, negative, or neutral. Using sentiment analysis tools to analyze opinions in Twitter data can help companies understand how people are talking about their brand.
Twitter boasts 330 million monthly active users, which allows businesses to reach a broad audience and connect with customers without intermediaries. On the downside, there’s so much information that it’s hard for brands to quickly detect negative social mentions that could harm their business.
It can also help understand the political sentiments and viewpoints of people depending upon what they tweet. The trending hashtags on twitter can also be used as the topics of which the sentiments are to be found of.
